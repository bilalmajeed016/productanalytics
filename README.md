# StockX auction analysis Project
# As you explore the bid data from the Ben Baller IPO (focus on the bid data during the IPO, excluding the bid-ask data from the secondary market), conduct some exploratory analysis of the data: 
# How many bids were received by color and shoe size? 
# Is there a relationship between number of bids and quantity available? Between bid amount and quantity available? 
# Find market clearing prices for the various shoe sizes, for black and red shoes separately. 
# Draw demand and supply curves for shoe size 10, red and black shoes separately. 
# Are there any outlier bids in the data? For which shoe sizes and colors? How should you treat outliers? 
# Which color received higher bids? Which shoe size received higher bids? 
# How much revenue did the auctions generate? Would increasing supply by 10% increase revenues? Would decreasing supply by 10% increase revenues?
